# Incident Response Templates

This section contains IR Templates referenced by the playbooks. Templates provide a way to create standard response actions that can be combined in different ways. 

## IR Phases

We have opted to condense the usual 6-phase IR process into 3 core stages:

- **identification**: the initial triage of the events referenced by the alert and definition of the investigation scope (assets, people, etc.).
- **containment**: actions required to limit the threat's effects on your infrastructure based on the security controls available in your organization. These actions need to link to practical processes at your disposal that the analyst can trigger (either manually or automatically) to achieve any of the following results: mitigation of the threat effects, dissuation of the threat intentions, evasion tactics that displace the threat's expected target location.
- **resolution**: this phase ties together *eradication* and *recovery* into one. The idea is to provide guidance on which steps need to be taken in order to eliminate the threat and bring affected systems back to normal functionalities.
